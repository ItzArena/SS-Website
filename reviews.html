                learning about all the different kinds of ways they had to adapt to with their conditions. I was very suprised about how they were able to come up with Chinampas and they
                looked stunning. It was like a floating island of vegetation. I am giving this 4 stars because i was kind of creeped out by the fact that over 50,000 people were sacrificed here
                all on one day but its a very minor thing that can be overlooked by all the amazing things you can see. Great Trip! I reccomend for anyone that wants to see something out of the ordinary.

                the Incan Empire was amazing. It was very calming and very interesting being able to walk into buildings that have been abandoned for years and being able to see them up
                close is a very cool experience. The fall of the Incan empire was a shame with the plague spreading and conquistadors attacking. But throughout all they've endured it still holds
                up as an amazing place. I think everyone should come once in their life to experience this. </p></div>

                    was very Interesting because of how much is still accessible to look at today. Being able to see everything that they were able to use back then is very fascinating. 
                    You can see how much they evolved and how close they got to modern day technology, especially with weapons. Its also incredible to imagine that over the span of 100 years they became
                    so powerful that they were known as a "World Power". Being able to see a lot of things still in tact and still being restored is amazing. 
                    I thought that Suleiman had a pretty cool hat too. 10/10</p></div>
